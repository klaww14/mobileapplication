1.	Introduction to Testing:
 o	Software testing is the process of evaluating our mobile banking application
to identify defects or bugs that may affect its functionality, security, or usability.
 o	Testing is crucial in the mobile banking development of our application,
to ensure reliability, security, and correctness, as any software malfunction can have
significant financial or security implications for users.
 o	The mobile banking application is set to adhere to strict regulatory standards
and compliance requirements set forth by our financial authorities.
Testing ensures that the application meets the standards, safeguarding against legal penalties and ensuring user trust.
 o	Beyond functionality, our mobile banking app must perform efficiently,
especially under peak load conditions. Performance testing evaluates 
factors like response time, throughput, and resource utilization that are used 
to ensure that our application can handle concurrent user interactions without slowdowns or crashes.


2.	Purpose of Testing:
  o	Testing is crucial in our mobile banking app development to ensure flawless operation,
top performance, and robust security. We rigorously test to uncover defects, protecting 
against breaches and fraud, maintaining user trust and financial security. 
  o	Early defect detection allows us to fix issues before they affect users, 
ensuring seamless and secure functionality. Our dedication to testing enhances user 
experience and solidifies our reputation as a trusted financial institution.
  o	Compliance with regulations is essential in banking. Thorough testing ensures we meet 
standards, reducing the risk of penalties and legal issues, while maintaining 
top-notch software quality, security, and privacy.
  o	In essence, by prioritizing comprehensive testing throughout our development 
lifecycle, we can confidently deliver a mobile banking application that not 
only meets the needs of our users but also aligns with industry standards and 
regulatory requirements, reinforcing our commitment to excellence in banking technology.


3.	Focus on Testing a Single Component:
  o	We choose a critical component of the mobile banking application
to test, such as the authentication system or transaction processing module.
  o	The testing of this component is done vital due to its role in ensuring the
security and integrity of our user data, as well as its impact on the overall functionality of the application.
  o	Testing examines how the authentication system handles various error scenarios,
such as incorrect passwords, expired sessions, and multiple failed login attempts. 
Proper error handling ensures that users receive clear and informative messages,
preventing confusion and enhancing the overall user experience.
  o	Since the authentication system interacts with other components of 
our mobile banking application, such as user profiles, account information, 
and transaction processing, integration testing is crucial. It ensures seamless 
communication and data exchange between the authentication system and other modules,
maintaining overall system functionality.

4.	Preparing Test Cases:
  o	Our team prepares test cases to cover various scenarios, including normal user 
interactions (e.g., logging in, transferring funds), edge cases (e.g., low network connectivity), 
and invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect password).
  o	Test cases are used to address security concerns, such as verifying encryption 
protocols and handling authentication failures.
  o	The application is tested thoroughly to find out how our system behaves 
under all possible input conditions. A clear understanding of software functions 
and the testing process can make writing tests that identify defects easier.
  o	These test cases ensure that our database meets its functional 
and non-functional requirements. They make sure database management systems (DBMS) support all of our business requirements.

5.	Choosing Testing Frameworks:
  o	Testing framework is essential when considering the requirements and 
constraints of the application, such as the platform, the type of application,
the programming language preference, and the testing requirements.
  o	For our mobile banking application it is developed in the language Swift 
which is essentially for iOS users and the testing is done by XCtest.
  o	We also used some of the open source tools to enable us  cost-effective testing solutions.

  6.	Writing Test Code + 7. Running tests:
Test codes are used to validate the functionality and the security 
of our banking applicationâ€™s components. Test methods are to simulate 
user with the authentication system, such as logging in with valid and 
invalid credentials, initiating transactions, and managing user sessions. The ones we have chosen are:

Authentication:

import XCTest
class AuthenticationUITests: XCTestCase {
    var app: XCUIApplication!
    override func setUpWithError() throws {
        continueAfterFailure = false
        app = XCUIApplication()
        app.launch()
    }
        func testSuccessfulLogin() throws {
        // Input valid username and password
        let usernameTextField = app.textFields["Username"]
        usernameTextField.tap()
        usernameTextField.typeText("example_user")
        let passwordTextField = app.secureTextFields["Password"]
        passwordTextField.tap()
        passwordTextField.typeText("password")
        // Tap on the login button
        app.buttons["Login"].tap()
        // Check if the welcome message is displayed
        XCTAssertTrue(app.staticTexts["Welcome, example_user!"].exists)
    }
    func testInvalidLogin() throws {
        // Input invalid username and password
        let usernameTextField = app.textFields["Username"]
        usernameTextField.tap()
        usernameTextField.typeText("invalid_user")
        let passwordTextField = app.secureTextFields["Password"]
        passwordTextField.tap()
        passwordTextField.typeText("invalid_password")
        // Tap on the login button
        app.buttons["Login"].tap()
        // Check if the error message is displayed
        XCTAssertTrue(app.staticTexts["Invalid username or password"].exists)
    }
    func testEmptyFields() throws {
        // Leave username and password fields empty
        app.buttons["Login"].tap()
        // Check if appropriate error messages are displayed
        XCTAssertTrue(app.staticTexts["Username cannot be empty"].exists)
